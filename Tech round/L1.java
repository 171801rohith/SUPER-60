// Problem Statement

// Level 1: Generate and Modify a Sequence
// 1. Generate an array of 100 integers where each number is a multiple of 9, starting from 9 (i.e., 9, 18, 27, 36,...). 
// 2. For each number, if the difference between its last two digits is 3, change that number to its negative form. 
//     Example: ï‚§ 36 has last two digits 3 and 6, the difference is 3, so it becomes -36. 63 has last two digits 6 and 3, the difference is 3, so it becomes -63. 
// 3. Display the final array with all 100 modified numbers. 
// 4. Display the sum of all these 100 numbers. 

// Level 2: Numbers with Prime Neighbors
// 1. From the array generated in Level 1, identify all numbers n where either n-1 or n+1 is a prime number. 
// 2. Display all such numbers that meet this criterion. 
// 3. Find and display the sum of all these numbers. 

// Level 3: Ascending Subarrays
// 1. From the array generated in Level 1, identify and display all subarrays where the numbers are in strictly ascending order. 
// 2. For each such subarray, calculate the sum of its elements. 
// 3. Display the sum of all these individual subarray sums. 
// 4. Display the number of subarrays. 
// 5. Finally, calculate and display the total sum of all the sums of the ascending subarrays.
